Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - { role: delete-files,
        LOCATION: "/opt/dev/atmosphere",
        GLOB: "*.pyc",
        tags: ['atmosphere'] }
```
or

```
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - { role: delete-files,
        LOCATION: "{{ ATMOSPHERE_LOCATION",
        GLOB: "*.bak*",
        tags: ['atmosphere'] }
```
